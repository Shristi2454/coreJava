 *  #===================== Class and Object ====================
 *  	Class :
 *  	=> Used to represent real world objects/entity/things.
 *  	=> It's a collection/group of objects having similar structure and behaviors.
 *  	=> Also called template/blue-print of object.
 *  	=> Class contains properties and methods.
 *  	=> Also known as reference data type or user defined data type.
 *  
 *  	Syntax:
 *  	class class_name{
 *  
 *  		//properties or features/instance variable
 *  
 *  		// methods/function/responsibilities
 *  
 *  	}
 *  
 *  	Object/Instance :
 *  	=> Implementation of class.
 *  	=> Instance of class is called object and vice-versa(vs).
 *  	=> Object contains instance variable and instance method.
 *  	=> Class allocates memory when object is created.
 *  	
 *  	syntax:
 *  		class_name object_name = new class_name();
 *
